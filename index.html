    <!-- this is just a comment and not meant for anything real-->
    <!-- we are going to create an unorderd list for the next lesson,

    <h3>The Odin Project Lessons: Links and Images</h3>
    <p>In this lesson we will learn the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to create links to pages on other websites on the internet</li>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click Me</a>
        <!-- we create a link to another page with the <a href="thewebpagebeinglinked">
            tag, do not forget your closing tags-->
        <li>How to create link to other pages on your own websites</li>
        <li>The difference between absolute and realtive links</li>
        <li>How to display an image on a webpage using HTML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Absolute links are links to content on another page, they will always contain
        the 
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images">protocol://domain/path format/</a>    </p>
        <p>Relative links are links to pages within our own website, like to go from menu to about us pages</p>
        <p>This works as long as the pages being traversed are within the same directory, 
            if not then you need to add to the link.</p>
        <h4>Images</h4>
        <p>You can add images to the page with an &lt;img&gt; tag. These are self closing tags, 
            that work in the same manor as relative and absolute links. You can also add alt text to an image
            for when the image doesn't load.
        </p>
        <h2>Commit messages</h2>
        <p>In this lesson we learn about the following</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How to write meaningful commit messages</li>
            <li>Why meaningful messages are important</li>
            <li>When to Commit</li>
            <p>Yes, commit messages are important enough to warrent their own lesson. Those reasons are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When applying for jobs employers will look through your commits, this could help you stand out, 
                    especially early in oyur career
                </li>
                <li>With a good commit history the team your are working with will be able to see where bugs have poped up</li>
                <li>It will also allow you to get back to work quicly on projects that have been on the shelf for a while.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you commit is also important for reason like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Commiting is like taking a snapshot of you code at that time, allowing you to revert back
                    when a bug happens, or when trying something new doesn't work the way you thought.
                </li>
                <li>It is considered best practice to make a commit with every meaningful code change.
                    This could mean anything from a bug, typo correction to even you have gained experiance and improved
                    the code of the page.
                </li>
                <li>It is even a good idea to commit when things are finally working the way they are suppose to.
                    This way when it does break you at least have a reference to time it worked properly.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
